# Workflow: Recurrence Escalation

## Objective

Trigger a systemic correction when recurring rework is not covered by current workflows.

## Preconditions

- Maintain period-based incident and rework records classified by domain and cause.
- Review existing workflows under `.pose/workflows/` to avoid duplication.
- Obtain area-owner confirmation that process escalation is necessary.

## Required recurrence metric

- **Name:** `recurrence_rework_uncovered`
- **Definition:** recurring incidents or rework during the period whose root cause is not covered by a current workflow.
- **Formula:** `uncovered_recurring_incidents / period`
- **Minimum dimensions:** domain (`frontend-react`, `backend-go`, `kubernetes`, `security`, `documentation-style`) and cause (`process`, `contract`, `implementation`, `validation`).

## Activation threshold

Activate this workflow when any condition is met in a rolling 30-day period:

- At least three uncovered recurring incidents in one domain.
- At least five uncovered recurring incidents across domains.
- Growth over two consecutive periods compared with the preceding 30 days.

## Execution checklist

1. Consolidate 30 days of `recurrence_rework_uncovered` evidence.
2. Classify failures by cause and execution root (`report_path`). A failed
   development retry followed by PASS remains immutable evidence, but it is
   not an uncovered incident unless the cause survives the current workflow.
3. Confirm that no current workflow covers the pattern and record the gap.
4. Create `.pose/workflows/<name>.md` with scope, preconditions, checks, and outputs.
5. Link the new workflow from applicable domain rules and from the review workflow when relevant.
6. Update the related spec with rationale, acceptance criteria, and residual risks.
7. Define an owner, pilot window, and pilot success criteria.
8. Run deterministic checks for every changed file.
9. Record the post-pilot decision: keep, adjust, or discard the workflow.

## Required rule linkage

Select rules cumulatively for every affected domain:

- `.pose/rules/security.md`
- `.pose/rules/backend-go.md`
- `.pose/rules/frontend-react.md`
- `.pose/rules/kubernetes.md` (extension `pose-rule-kubernetes`, when installed)
- `.pose/rules/documentation-style.md`
- `.pose/rules/knowledge-governance.md` when knowledge or process artifacts change

Apply the most restrictive rule when they conflict.

## Adoption review

Register the intervention when the escalation ships, so the review is
measured, not remembered (spec pose-recurrence-effectiveness):

```bash
pose recurrence-effect --register --task <task-slug> \
  --ref rule:<name>|workflow:<name>|spec:<slug> \
  --window-days 45 --rationale "<why this intervention>" --author @<alias>
```

Review the pilot after the observation window:

- Run `pose recurrence-effect` — it compares recurrence rate (and recorded
  duration/cost) before and after the intervention from append-only history,
  with data-quality warnings for sparse samples or incomplete windows.
- Require at least a 30 percent reduction in the target domain.
- Evaluate operational cost, execution time, and evidence quality
  (`pose report --duration-seconds/--cost-usd` feeds the telemetry).
- Issue a formal `keep`, `adjust`, or `discard` decision.
- An `INEFFECTIVE` verdict is not tolerable silence: reopen or spawn an
  owned, dated follow-up with an exit criterion (`adjust`/`discard`) —
  creating the escalation was never the success condition.

## Required outputs

- Evidence that the metric crossed its activation threshold.
- A published and referenced specialized workflow.
- An explicit map of applied rules.
- Pilot-review results and final decision.
- Residual risks and a mitigation plan.
