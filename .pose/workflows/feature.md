# Workflow: Feature

## Objective

Deliver a production feature with clear scope, incremental implementation, and deterministic validation.

## Preconditions

- Make the business requirement and acceptance criteria explicit.
- Identify the affected directories.
- Create or update the related spec under `.pose/specs/`.
- Map technical dependencies and initial risks.

## Execution checklist

1. Confirm the objective, constraints, and affected public contracts.
2. Map affected modules and read relevant local instructions.
3. Map impacted modules and run `pose assess discover [--component <dir>]` to inspect metrics, LOCs, and debts of the module before editing.
4. Search `.pose/knowledge/` for relevant handoffs, notes, and decision logs; cite each consulted artifact in the spec as `knowledge:<slug>`. That exact form is what `pose knowledge-usage` counts — prose naming a file is invisible to it, so an artifact everyone reads can still look unused and expire on TTL.
5. Review or create the spec with intent, requirements, and tasks.
6. Declare exact source-tree actions under `### Artifacts`; keep declaration separate from Git-observed evidence.
7. Plan small, reversible delivery increments.
8. Implement incrementally and validate each meaningful step.
9. Run `pose artifact-check --spec <slug> --from <base> --to <head> --strict` against an immutable attributed change set.
10. When the spec declares `delivers`, run validation to a structured result and require `pose surface-check --spec <slug> --strict`; build/unit alone never prove composition or reachability.
11. Run applicable deterministic checks: test, lint, typecheck, and build.
12. Review security, observability, and operational-documentation impact.
13. If touching inter-component contracts (Protobuf, Kafka, REST, MCP), run `pose assess integrate`.
14. Create a reusable handoff with `pose new-knowledge handoff <slug>` when another execution needs partial state, a pending decision, or a follow-up; link the spec through `source_refs`.
15. Summarize the result, residual risks, and next steps.
16. Run a separate review pass. With bundle policy enabled, prepare and seal with `pose review bundle spec:<slug> --seal`, then bind the decision with `pose review attest <bundle-id> ... --apply`; otherwise use the legacy `pose review record` flow.
17. Require `pose review verify spec:<slug>` (bundle mode) and `pose closeout-check spec:<slug>` before applying `pose close spec:<slug>`; remediation that changes semantic or source inputs creates a superseding bundle.
18. Complete follow-up and changelog disposition (`pose followups --all` shows the cross-spec backlog and its collisions), run `pose assess discover --update-state` to recalculate platform completeness; then pass `pose lint-spec <slug> --strict`.

## Required outputs

- Summarize changes by module and file.
- Attach commands and status for executed validation.
- Update specs and documentation when behavior changes.
- List residual risks with mitigation or a follow-up plan.

## Definition of done

- Meet all acceptance criteria with verifiable evidence.
- Preserve public contracts or document intentional changes.
- Pass every relevant deterministic check.
- Keep scope controlled and exclude unrelated refactors.
- Close the spec with a current approved review, `status: done`, `completed_at`, and dispositioned follow-ups.

## Planner mode

**Objective:** turn intent into an executable plan with controlled scope, explicit risks, and defined validation.

- **Focus:** understand the problem precisely; delimit modules and contracts; sequence verifiable increments; define deterministic checks early.
- **Anti-patterns:** omit constraints or dependencies; create a plan too large for incremental validation; ignore existing specs and workflows; assume risk is absent without evidence.
- **Handoff:** prioritize small steps, identify target files and boundaries, assign mandatory checks per step, and highlight residual implementation risks.

## Implementer mode

**Objective:** execute the plan through cohesive, production-safe changes with continuous validation.

- **Focus:** make the smallest high-impact changes; follow scope and local conventions; validate every relevant increment; communicate trade-offs and residual risks.
- **Anti-patterns:** expand scope with unsolicited refactors; change public contracts without specs or docs; accumulate large unvalidated changes; fix symptoms without investigating root cause.
- **Handoff:** summarize the diff and rationale, executed commands and results, limitations and follow-ups, and review-sensitive areas.
