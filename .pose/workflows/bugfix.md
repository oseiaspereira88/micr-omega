# Workflow: Bugfix

## Objective

Fix the root cause with the smallest possible impact, regression coverage, and operational safety.

## Preconditions

- The failure is reproduced (or objective evidence of the defect is recorded).
- The bug scope and affected components are identified.
- There is a testable root-cause hypothesis.
- There is a validation plan that prevents regression.

## Execution checklist

1. Reproduce the problem and define an observable failure mode.
2. **Consult `.pose/knowledge/`** for earlier incidents or handoffs in the same module or failure pattern; reuse an existing diagnosis when available and cite it in the spec as `knowledge:<slug>` — `pose knowledge-usage` counts that exact form, so an uncited artifact reads as unused and expires on TTL.
3. Isolate the root cause and map collateral impact.
4. Define the smallest safe fix and a rollback plan.
5. Implement the fix as a cohesive change, without parallel refactoring.
6. Add or adjust a regression test when applicable.
7. Run relevant deterministic checks (`test`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `build`).
8. Validate that the defect is gone and adjacent behavior is preserved.
9. **Create a decision log** in `.pose/knowledge/` when the root cause reveals systemic debt or a trade-off with future impact (`pose new-knowledge decision-log <slug>`).
10. Record residual risks and post-fix monitoring.

## Required outputs

- Description of the defect, root cause, and fix approach.
- Evidence of regression coverage through a test or equivalent validation.
- Results of the executed checks.
- Residual risks, monitoring plan, and rollback plan when needed.

## Definition of done

- The defect no longer reproduces in the target scenario.
- Regression is covered by a suitable deterministic test or validation.
- No behavior outside the scope changed inadvertently.
- Relevant checks completed successfully.

## Execution — implementer mode

**Objective:** fix the root cause with minimal changes, without expanding scope.

- **Focus:** isolate the root cause before any fix; make a cohesive change without parallel refactoring; provide regression coverage before merge; clearly communicate the trade-off between a minimal fix and systemic prevention.
- **Anti-patterns:** fix a symptom without investigating the cause; mix a bugfix with an unrequested refactor; change a public contract to hide the defect; accumulate changes without validation checkpoints.
- **Handoff:** a surgical diff with rationale; executed regression test; residual risk and monitoring; review attention points, especially code near the fix.
