# Skill: pose-doc-update

## Required reading

1. [`.pose/workflows/documentation-update.md`](../../../.pose/workflows/documentation-update.md).
2. [`.pose/rules/documentation-style.md`](../../../.pose/rules/documentation-style.md).
3. Root [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) and [POSE.md](../../../POSE.md) for root-level scope.

## Steps

1. Choose the correct source: AGENTS for the short contract, POSE for the manual, workflows for procedures, and rules for cumulative domain constraints.
2. Use imperative language, short bullets, consistent terms, and links to a single source of truth.
3. Use [`.pose/templates/doc-audit-report.md`](../../../.pose/templates/doc-audit-report.md) for broad editorial audits.
4. Run `pose check --strict` after reference changes.
5. Generate a `doc-audit` report for broad changes with `pose report --type doc-audit --task "<audit>"`.

## Output requirements

- Cohesive, readable diff with one editorial intent per commit.
- No verbatim duplication across files.
- Green `pose check --strict`.
- Optional doc-audit report for broad changes.
