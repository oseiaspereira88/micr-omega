# POSE skills index

Skills package recurring workflows in a format agents can consume. Claude Code
uses the symlinks under [`.claude/skills/`](../../.claude/skills/); other agents
read `.agents/skills/` directly.

Each `SKILL.md` uses YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, and
`when_to_use`, followed by Required reading, Steps, and Output requirements.

## Machine-readable routing

```bash
pose suggest <task-type> [--path <dir>] [--json]
```

The source of truth is [`.pose/indexes/task-map.json`](../../.pose/indexes/task-map.json).
`pose check` validates referenced workflows, skills, and rules.

## Scope rule

Load only the skill for the current task type and the `AGENTS.md` files needed
for affected paths. Do not read the entire catalog by default.
